# Simple C# Tic Tac Toe

## Project Description

This Tic-Tac-Toe Game project is a console-based application developed in C# and .NET. It implements the classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a winning pattern before their opponent.

In the future, I aim to expand the game to support larger grid sizes or alternative game variants, and also incorporate unit testing to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
